# MS1 Liz O'Neill - Psychotherapy

The site is aimed at offering psycotherapy services to clients and also provide information for family members/friends looking to get help for loved ones.
There is also some scope to collaborate with similar minded services who's brand is inline with Liz's and also to work with fellow psychotherapists. 
Due to the nature of the topic it is intended to provide information with a relaxed approach, for this reason there will not be a large amount of call to 
action points or direct sales pitches as it's important the client believes Liz is a good match for their needs.

Walking therapy is a fairly new approach to therapy service and encourages a different approach and feeling towards the help people may need, the style of the 
site should reflect this and feel calming and organic. Naturally walking is not for everyone so traditional therapy style services will be offered along with 
online services given the impact of COVID.

## UX
------
### User stories

* As a potential client, I want to find the information regarding how the therapy works and if it and Liz is a good match for what I'm looking for, if so it then needs 
to be easy to get in contact with Liz.
* As a friend or family member of someone who needs help, I want to see if Liz's services would be a good match for the individual I'm concerned about, I would then want to 
be able to put them intouch with Liz, or share some of her social media with my friend/family member to encourage them to seek help.
* As a potential collaborator, I want to see the style and work done by Liz to see if our brands outlook match one another, if so I need to be able to make contact 
with Liz to start the discussion.
* As a fellow psyhcotherapist, I will be looking to learn how to approach walking therapy as a new style of service that is very uncommon at the moment, I would like to contact 
Liz to either learn from her or to work with her in offering services to a broader geographical range of clients.

### Strategy

My goal in the design is to make a very clean, relaxed site conveying all the information required by all users. There needs to be a simple contact form and also contact details.

### Scope

For clients there needs to be an explanation of the services on offer along with background information on who Liz is. Social media links is a modern approach to offering psycotherapy 
services that is being promoted as a way to make it seam as it should be more socially acceptable and easier to approach the topic.

### Structure

With there being a large amount of information and text inparticularly it's important to break the site into seperate pages allowing clients to jump to what they want to know 
without the need to over scroll. The site will be broken down to Home Page, Types of therapy on offer explained, What to expect/who is Liz, Collaborations and social feeds, contact
page and how to start the process.

### Skeleton



### Surface

Liz's branding is already working with a color pallet which needs to continue through the site.
